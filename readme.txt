CharacterGenerator is an excercise in object-oriented programming. It is a text-based character generator, in the vein of
the same in Dwarf Fortress.

Usage: navigate to this directory in your terminal emulator of choice and enter `python CharGenExplorer.py`
Choose whether to generate a list of characters or just one. You'll be shown a list of names. To see the physical
description of each character, go back to the main menu and select option 3. 
Currently there is no way to delete or save characters: if you want to reset the list just exit and re-run the script.

The program simply makes a random choice of traits and name phonemes from the given lists. Future versions should go into more 
detail, including things like personality traits, occupations, and personal aspirations. 

To adapt the program to your own setting, go into Chargen.py and edit the stored values as you wish.
